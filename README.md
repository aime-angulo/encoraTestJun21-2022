Angular Assessment for XUP Payment

This is almost the same methodology as in the assessment but with fixed errors I was not able to see due to the UI issue: 
-The service is to send the incoming value and it's up to the countby component to stack the log.
-The service is calculating the previous and current value.
-The countby component's template handles the date with the proper pipe and format. Also its template has log overflow handling.
-The CSS allows the requested style by using Flex Layout.
-App component wraps the custom value input with a form and uses simple HTML number validation.
